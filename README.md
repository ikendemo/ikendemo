Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate **Data Engineer** with a keen interest in building scalable data pipelines, optimizing storage architectures, and enabling data-driven decision-making.

## **Aspiring CTO with a Data-Driven Vision** ##

I aspire to become a **Chief Technology Officer**, focusing on Data Infrastructure and Scalable Architecture to drive innovation. What I really love is being a bridge builder between complex data and actionable insights. Translating raw data requirements between stakeholders and engineering teams, then presenting robust data solutions back to the business.

It is my long-term goal to be able to work remotely from anywhere in the globe so I can build, or rebuild, communities around the world that have been hurt or destroyed by disasters using the power of technology and information.

### **About Me** ###
